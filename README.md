# WYSIWYG Text editor

A rich text / HTML editor inspired by reddit's editor

## WIP

This is still in WIP stage, however, the editor is already fully functional.

You can see a demo by cloning the project and the running it in a dev environment using

```bash
pnpm run dev
```

This text editor will be used on the pyrodata.com website to edit pages but also used as the 
default 'leave a comment' editor.

A guide on how to extend its functionality, like adding custom buttons will be added into 
using a dedicated documentation page on the pyrodata.com website in a later stage.
